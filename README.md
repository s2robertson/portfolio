# UTor Bootcamp Challenge 2: Portfolio

## Description
This repo is meant to act as a landing page to showcase my portfolio of projects, and to act
as an early entry demonstrating HTML and CSS.  It contains a brief bio, a list of projects, and 
contact details.  The phone number and email entries are currently artificial; if I add the 
real details at a later date, it will be behind a captcha.  A major part of the assignment was 
to make the page responsive to different sizes using flexbox, grid, and media queries.  I
chose to adopt a mobile first approach, and made the page scale based on font size.
